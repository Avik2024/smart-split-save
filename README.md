# ðŸš€ Smart Split & Save

**Smart Split & Save** is a realâ€‘time fintech platform that allows users to create shared savings goals with friends, family, or colleagues â€” automatically splitting contributions and applying adaptive savings rules.  

This project demonstrates **full endâ€‘toâ€‘end engineering skills**: microservices architecture, event-driven backend, caching strategies, adaptive rule engines, cloud deployment, monitoring, and a modern frontend dashboard.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Purpose

Managing shared savings is often tedious and manual. Smart Split & Save solves this by:
- Enabling **real-time shared goals** (e.g., holidays, rent, gifts).
- **Automatically splitting payments** based on contributions.
- Applying **adaptive saving rules** (round-ups, % salary savings, custom rules).
- Providing a **beautiful dashboard** with real-time tracking.
- Offering **notifications and insights** to keep users motivated.

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Features

- **User Management** â€” registration, authentication, profile management.
- **Shared Goals** â€” create, join, track progress.
- **Automatic Splitting** â€” real-time contribution calculation.
- **Adaptive Rules Engine** â€” ML-powered savings suggestions.
- **Notifications** â€” real-time updates via WebSocket.
- **Dashboard** â€” interactive charts and goal summaries.
